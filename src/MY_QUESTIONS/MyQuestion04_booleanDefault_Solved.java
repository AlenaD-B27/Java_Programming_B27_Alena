//        The default value for any quantity is 0, because it is the value when all of the bits are zero. This of course is different from “uninitialized”, and the default may be different when working with complex structures with other default constructors.
//
//                However, you may then be wondering why false is 0.
//
//        It doesn’t have to be, but it’s easy to understand that if 1 is true, then AND can act like multiplication (with 0 being the identity element), and OR is a bit like addition, but with a maximum value of 1 (1 + 1 = 1, not 2).
//
//        This connection with how Boolean Logic can almost look like typical arithmetic is one good justification for why 0 was picked as false, and hence why false is the default.
